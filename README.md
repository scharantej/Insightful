 ## Python Flask Expert Assistant

### Data Exploration
[Problem Statement]

### Flask Application Design

#### HTML Files

- **index.html**: This will serve as the main page of the application. It will contain the necessary HTML elements to display the user interface, such as input fields, buttons, and a section to display the results.

- **results.html**: This HTML file will be used to display the results of the data analysis. It will contain the necessary HTML elements to present the results in a user-friendly manner, such as tables, charts, or text.

#### Routes

- **@app.route('/')**: This route will handle the main page of the application. It will render the index.html file.

- **@app.route('/analyze', methods=['POST'])**: This route will handle the data analysis. It will receive the user input from the index.html file and perform the necessary data analysis. The results of the analysis will be stored in a variable and passed to the results.html file.

- **@app.route('/results')**: This route will render the results.html file, displaying the results of the data analysis.

### Additional Notes

- The specific implementation of the data analysis logic will depend on the nature of the problem statement.
- The HTML files and routes can be further customized to enhance the user experience and provide additional functionality.
- Error handling and input validation should be implemented to ensure the robustness of the application.
